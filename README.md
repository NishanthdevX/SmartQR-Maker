üì¶ Modern QR Code Generator
‚ú® Project Overview
Modern QR Code Generator is a web-based application that allows users to generate customized QR codes quickly and easily. Built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, the tool provides a sleek, responsive interface designed to work smoothly across both desktop and mobile devices.

When a user enters a URL, the application automatically processes it to generate a high-quality QR code. Additionally, it intelligently tries to fetch the favicon (website logo) from the given domain and embeds it in the center of the QR code. If no favicon is available, the generator can fall back to a default placeholder, ensuring the QR code always looks complete and attractive.

The app also offers several user-friendly features like:

Download the QR code as an image.

Copy the QR code directly to the clipboard.

Share the QR code via supported device sharing methods.

The overall experience is enhanced with a modern design that includes smooth loading animations, intuitive button interactions, and mobile-friendly scaling. The QR code generation uses the qrcodejs library, while logo insertion is managed dynamically using Canvas.

Important Note:
This project was created and refined with assistance from AI (ChatGPT), helping to speed up the development, ensure clean structure, and optimize performance.
